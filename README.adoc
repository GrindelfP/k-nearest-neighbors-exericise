= K-Nearest Neighbors excercise =

A small exercise on understanding of concept of K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm. The exercise follows this steps:
1. create 3 groups of 140 2-dimentional points on a 2-dimentional plane
2. experiment with cluster standart coefficients
3. develop a function implementing K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm
4. test the function on some additional points and show them on the plane

The task is done using Google Colab.
